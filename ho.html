    <h1 class="porttitle">H2Organizer</h1>
    <p>H2Organizer is a straightforward app that allows the user to effectively track water and other drink consumption.
     My focus with this project was on Interaction Design. My goals were two-fold: to create a highly intuitive design and 
     create interactions that are rewarding to the user and promote further use.</p>

    <p class="title">My Role</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Heuristically analyze an existing water app and redesign it in a way that can effectively achieve my design goals</li>
        <li>Redesign the website to meet those criteria</li>
     </ul>
     <p class="title">Tools used</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Initial Research</h2>
    <p> 
        To no surprise, there is a wide variety of water tracker apps in the app store. What came as more of a surprise was the 
        lack of good ones. I saw overly complicated and thus overwhelming apps. These are one-task apps, they should be as 
        intuitive and simple as it gets. I also saw a lack of rewarding visuals and animations; with something so simple there 
        is a good opportunity to build polished interactive animations that reward the user for using the app.
    </p>
    <p class="title">The Problems:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Overwhelming app designs all around</li>
        <li>Task-flows are hard to manage</li>
        <li>Lack of quality visual aesthetics</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>Simplicity is the name of the game here. In creating my wireframes I wanted designs that allowed for comprehensive 
        and rewarding interactives and a straight forward task-flow.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Design Goals:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Design an app with a manageable task-flow</li>
        <li>Simple.Simple.Simple.</li>
        <li>Design a nuetral and quality aesthetic with rewarding interaction</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Wireflow</h2>
    <p>My initial wire flow was my first chance to showcase the simple task flow I wanted to implement. The task flow
        can be achieved in 1-4 clicks.
    </p>

    <h2>IX-Flow</h2>
    <p>Designing quality interactive animations for my app was one of the main goals of this project. I wanted some light and 
    fun animations that rewarded the user for completing certain tasks within the app. Additionally, I wanted my interactives 
    to contribute to the simplicity and intuitiveness of my app. I began my ideation process with sketches of potential 
    interactive animations. I then chose the best after personal analysis and peer review. After that I mapped out the flow 
    and definition of these interactions.
