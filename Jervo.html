    <p>
        In November of last year, my professor, Jervo, assigned a project to create our own portfolio websites.
        I decided to give his website a visit for inspiration. In doing so, I found his website to be rather 
        confusing and lacking on the design front. . </p>

    <p>   
        This was perfect timing, another professor in my interaction design class had just assigned us to 
        redesign a website of our choosing. We were given 8 weeks to redesign 4 pages. After surveying my peers, 
        I found that most of them were in agreement: Jervo.org needed a redesign.

        <li>Redesign the website to meet those criteria</li>

    <h2 class="ogwebsite">Original Website</h2>
    <img src="images/jervooglayout.png" alt="Original Website">
    <h2>Initial Obersvations</h2>
    <p> <span class="bold"> What I saw:</span> A website that was slightly outdated and difficult to digest 
    along with general lack of a welcoming aesthetic. The website is boxy and text heavy. </p> 
    <p class="title">The Problems:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Many of the pages are overwhelming and busy</li>
        <li>Text heavy</li>
        <li>Lacks color</li>
        <li>Certain pages feel outdated</li>
        <li>Lacks visual appel</li>
    </ol>
   <p class="title">Redesign Goals:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Craft a welcoming and straightforward home page</li>
        <li>Reorganize pages to be less overwhelming in content</li>
        <li>Improve the general aesthetic of the website</li>
        <li>Add some interactive animations</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="ogwebsite">The Redesign</h2>
    <h2>Atoms</h2>
    <p>A primary focus is on Blue and Yellow to represent Drexel colors (I made them a little different from
         the exact colors so it wasn't so on the nose) with earthier orange and green accents to preserve the personality in 
         the original website. I chose Overpass, regular, and all of its additional weights and styles for most of the text for 
         its playful but accessible traits. I also redesigned the header logo to be bolder and more confident while keeping the 
         street/graffiti feel.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting</h2>
    <p>This project was my first time doing everything, from my first time in Figma to my first time writing a case study. 
        I am proud of what I accomplished in that little amount of time, especially considering I came in with no knowledge of anything. 
        More than anything, this project has excited me to create more and improved portfolio projects down the road as I develop my 
        craft and begin to personalize my style.
