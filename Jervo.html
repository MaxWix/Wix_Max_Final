    <p>
        In November of last year, my professor, Jervo, assigned a project to create our own portfolio websites. 
        I decided to give his website a visit for inspiration. In doing so, I found his website to be rather 
        confusing and lacking on the design front. </p>

    <p>   
        The was perfect timing, another professor in my interaction design class had just assigned us to redesign 
        a website of our choosing. We were given 8 weeks to redesign 3 pages. After surveying my peers, I found 
        that most of them were in agreement: Jervo.org needed a redesign.

    <h2>Initial Obersvations</h2>
    
    <p>This project was my introduction to the world of UX and UI. It was a learn-as-you-go kind of deal.</p>
    <p> <span class="bold"> What I saw:</span> A website that was slightly outdated and difficult to digest. Was this a personal website? 
        Or a professional one? At first glance, it's hard to tell. I also noticed a general lack of a welcoming aesthetic.
        The website is boxy and text heavy. </p> 
    
    
    <p class="title">The Problems:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Many of the pages are overwhelming and busy</li>
        <li>Text heavy</li>
        <li>Lacks color</li>
        <li>Certain pages feel outdated</li>
        <li>Lacks viusal appel</li>
    </ol>
   <p class="title">Redesign Goals:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Craft a welcoming and straightforward home page</li>
        <li>Reorganize pages to be less overwhelming in content</li>
        <li>Improve the general aesthetic of the website</li>
        <li>Add some interactive animations</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Reflecting</h2>
    <p>This project was my first time doing everything, from my first time in Figma to my first time writing a case study. 
        I am proud of what I accomplished in that little amount of time, especially considering I came in with no knowledge of anything. 
        More than anything, this project has excited me to create more and improved portfolio projects down the road as I develop my 
        craft and begin to personalize my style.
