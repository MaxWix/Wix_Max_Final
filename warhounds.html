    <h1 class="porttitle">War Hounds</h1>
    <p>Warhounds is a fast-paced multiplayer board game where players compete against each other to hold land and fight 
    their way across the board. It can be played by 4-6 players and takes around 30 minutes from end to end. I worked 
    with a team of 3 game designers to create this exciting and captivating analog board game.

    <p class="title">My Role</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manage initial research</li>
        <li>Facilitate and guide the brainstorming process</li>
        <li>Lead user-testing</li>
        <li>Build physical board</li>
        <li>Ensure the rulebook was comprehensive and allowed the user the play the game to its fullest</li>
     </ul>
     <p class="title">Tools used</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
        <li>Universal Laser Cutter</li>
        <li>Procreate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Initial Research</h2>
    <p>
        There is a general standard for in-depth game analysis. A framework developed by Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, and 
        Robert Zubek called the MDA framework, which stands for Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics. It is used to break game 
        design and consumption into distinct categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mechanics involve a game's individual components</li>
        <li>Dynamics involve the behavior and playability of those mechanics</li>
        <li>Aesthetics involve the visual and emotion responses of the player whilst playing the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Giving proper consideration to each element of the MDA framework while making our game would help us achieve what is 
        called Cognitive flow. Cognitive Flow is the idea of a game inducing a heightened level of engagement usually based 
        on a perfect ratio of required skill to the challenge at hand. In other words, being in the zone.
    </p>
    <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
    <p>While brainstorming we struggled not to go overboard. By the end of our first brainstorming session, we had come up 
        with a game that was far too complicated. We had a sea of ideas and needed to boil them down to just a few. After 
        realizing how unrealistic we were being, we set some criteria to help us stick to something comprehendible and 
        achievable.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Our rule book should not have to be more than 2 pages.</li>
        <li>Our game should be playable in no more than 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Our game should not be difficult and should not require an unreasonable amount of skill</li>
     </ol>

     <h2>Prototyping</h2>
     <p>As soon as we had a general idea of the game, we made some prototypes. The faster we could try playing the game 
        ourselves, the faster we could continue to adjust and improve everything.
    </p>
    <p class="title">What we learned from our initial prototypes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The general flow of the game needed to be vastly improved, it was taking too long to achieve certain objectives</li>
            <li>The game was too hard; certain rules and objectives were still too complicated and needed to be dumbed down</li>
            <li>We needed to add aspects of the game the helped players move toward objectives</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Play Testing</h2>
    <p>
        After making more improvements, we had other Game-Design and UX peers play our game. We handed them our list of rules, 
        the prototype board, and materials, and observed without providing any further guidance. After a bit of struggle, they 
        ultimately got the gist of the game, which was a great sign we were headed in the right direction.
    </p>
    <p>What we learned:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Our rule book was still too complicated, it needed to be dumb downed. Definitely needed a visual or two as well</li>
        <li>The objective of the game needed to be better defined</li>
        <li>Everything, from the rule book to the gameplay, still needed some simplifying.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Reflecting</h2>
    <p>This was a super fun project and we were extremely happy with how it came out. This was a great learning experience for 
    me, it was my first time working with a group of non-UX designers on a project. The different perspectives from different 
    industry backgrounds gave us a huge advantage and allowed us to work efficiently. War Hounds has become a favorite amongst 
    our friends and family. It's been a ton of fun to play. There are few things more enjoyable then seeing people truly enjoy 
    something you worked hard on to create. We are currently looking into working towards publication.
