    <p>A board game? a game design class? What does that have to do with UX and UI? Those were my initial
        thoughts when I started this class and this project. Oh, how wrong I was. For my first non-web-related 
        project, 3 game design peers and I were to build a board game from scratch. This was something new and exciting. 

        â€‹
        
        We came up with War Hounds: a strategy/war tabletop game. The objective is to make a complete trail from 
        players' starting points to the opposite side of the map. Players can battle each other along the way with 
        their dog-themed cards in order to gain territory and sabotage opponents.
    </p>
    <h2>Initial Research</h2>
    <p>
        We first wanted to do some digging on what makes a game, specifically an analog, game good. The first major
        thing we found was that there is a  general standard for in-depth game analysis. A framework developed by 
        Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, and Robert Zubek called the MDA framework, which stands for Mechanics, Dynamics, 
        and Aesthetics. It is used to break game design and consumption into distinct categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mechanics involve a game's individual components</li>
        <li>Dynamics involve the behavior and playability of those mechanics</li>
        <li>Aesthetics involve the visual and emotion responses of the player whilst playing the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Giving proper consideration to each element of the MDA framework, amongst other things, would help 
        us achieve what is called Cognitive flow. Cognitive Flow is the idea of a game inducing a heightened 
        level of engagement usually based on a perfect ratio of required skill to the challenge at hand. 
        In other words, being in the zone.
    </p>
    <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
    <p>We are a very creative group, which usually would be a great thing. But whilst brainstorming we 
        struggled not to go overboard. By the end of our first brainstorming session, we had come up with a 
        game concept more complicated than any analog game I had ever played. We had so many good ideas and 
        needed to learn to get rid of most of them. After realizing how unrealistic we were being, we decided 
        to set some goals/ criteria to help us stick to something comprehendible and achievable.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Our rule book should not have to be more than 2 pages.</li>
        <li>Our game should be playable in no more than 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Our game should not be difficult and should not require an unreasonable amount of skill</li>
     </ol>

     <h2>Prototyping</h2>
     <p>As soon as we had a general idea of the game, we made some quick prototypes. The faster we could try 
        playing the game ourselves, the faster we could continue to adjust and improve everything. Our prototyping 
        showed us that we needed to improve our game flow. The game needed to be a little bit easier, and there 
        needed to be some aspects of the game that helped move the players forward.

    <h2>Play Testing</h2>
    <p>
        After making our own improvements, we had some of our peers come and play our game. We handed them our 
        list of rules, the prototype board and materials, and observed. After a bit of struggle they ultimately 
        got the gist of the game, which was a great sign we were headed in the right direction.
    </p>
    <p>What we learned:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Our rule book was still too complicated, it needed to be dumb downed. Definitely needed a visual or two as well</li>
        <li>The objective of the game needed to be better defined</li>
        <li>Everything, from the rule book to the gameplay, still needed some simplifying.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Reflecting</h2>
    <p>This was a super fun project, and we were extremely happy with how it came out. This was a great learning 
        experience for me, it was my first time working with a group of non-UX designers on a project. The different 
        perspectives from different industry backgrounds gave us a huge advantage. War Hounds has become a favorite 
        amongst our friends. It's been a ton of fun to play. There are few things more enjoyable then seeing people 
        truly enjoy something you worked hard on to create. We are currently looking into the possibility of working 
        towards publication of War Hounds.
