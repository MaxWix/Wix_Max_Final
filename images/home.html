    <h1 class="PortTitle">H2Organizer</h1>
    <p>The purpose of my third and last UXID project involved learning about effective interaction design, 
        particularly IX design in adobe after effects. My first two classes, in which I worked on the Jervo.org 
        redesign, taught general UX and UI theories and concepts as well as introduced Figma. The H2Organizer project 
        involves those learned skills as well as IX design.</p>

    <p>
        I chose to design a water tracker app for its simplicity. I wanted to master Interaction Design and didn't 
        want to overwhelm myself with designing and mapping out an overly complex app.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>Initial Research</h2>
    <p>This project was my introduction to the world of UX and UI. It was a learn-as-you-go kind of deal.</p>
      <p> 
        To no surprise, there is a wide variety of water tracker apps in the app store. What came as more of a surprise was the
        lack of good ones. What I saw were way overly complicated and thus overwhelming apps. These are one-task apps, they should
        be as intuitive and simple as it gets.
    </p>
    <p class="title">The Problems:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Overwhelming app designs all around</li>
        <li>Task-flows are hard to manage</li>
        <li>Lack of quality visual aesthetics</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <img src="./home_files/Wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe">
    <p>Simplicity is the name of the game here. In creating my wireframes I wanted designs that allowed for comprehensive interactives
       and straight a straight forward task-flow.&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p class="title">Design Goals:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Design an app with a manageable task-flow</li>
        <li>Simple.Simple.Simple.</li>
        <li>Design a neutral and quality aesthetic</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Wireflow</h2>
    <p>My initial wire flow was my first chance to showcase the simple task flow I wanted to implement. The task flow
        can be achieved in 1-4 clicks.
    </p>

    <h2>IX-Flow</h2>
    <p>Designing some quality animations for my app was one of the main goals of this project. I wanted some light and fun animations that 
        rewarded the user for completing certain tasks within the app. Additionally, I wanted my interactives to contribute to the simplicity 
        and intuitiveness of my app.&nbsp;
